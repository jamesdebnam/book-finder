# book-finder
A little web-app where you input 3 books, and it will recommend you 10 based on the books you entered. 

Built (almost) entirely from vanilla js, CSS, and HTML.

Libraries used:
* axios (for API requests)
* browserify (to bundle the various files together)
* tape (for a bit of API testing)

APIs used:
Google books - To get general book info (titles, authors etc..)
Tastedive - For the actual recommendations
